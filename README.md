## Diggernaut

A fast-paced action rogue-like with infinite digging downward, mechanically similar to Mr. Driller, but with some dungeon elements.  Digging never stops, collect treasure and Diggerang upgrades on your way down, complete sets of items for high scores.  Clusters of like-bricks will break together (like Mr Driller) but clusters won't form and collapse above you (unlike Mr. Driller)

Game will feature an inventory that's displayed on pause with tabs for each collection.

Player is armed with a double-ended shovel (Diggerang) that can be thrown.

Verbs:
    Dig (obviously)
    helicopter
        player can twirl diggerang above their head to temporarily slow fall in open spaces.
    Power drill
        player can spin diggerang below them to bulldoze through blocks at a very rapid pace
        items that you would normally collect are destroyed by power drill action, so care must be     taken
    throw
        kill bats and dragons by throwing your diggerang at them.
        attempting to hit a dragon with a throw carries the risk of your Diggerang being eaten.
        bash the action button to return the Diggerang from a stuck state

hazards:
    falling rocks from above
    voids / free fall spaces
    bats
    underground dragon

Pre-created sets of items will be procedurally placed throughout the world (lots of pixel art opportunities here)
    Gems (target 16, more if time)
    Bones -
    Artifacts
